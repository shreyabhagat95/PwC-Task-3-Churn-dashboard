# PwC-Task-3-Churn-dashboard
Customer Churn & Risk Analysis Dashboard in Power BI
Task - Analyze the data regarding customers usage of services to see what metrics can help to identify customers that are most likely to churn.
Steps followed :
1. Created multiple visuals for every data available in source table to identify trends in churning.
2. Found few metrics that were common for most customer that churning.
3. Created DAX Measures and column to explore more about these metrics ->CALCULATE(), SUM(), MAX() etc.

Few of the insights are as follows-
1. Out of all the 7043 customers, 27 % of the customers have churned last month.
2. Tenure and contract plays an important role in determining whether the customer will churn or not.
3. Customers with monthly contract i.e. lower tenure will switch frequently.
4. Customers without any dependents and partners will churn more.
5. Gender type doesn't have a direct impact on the churn decision. Non-senior citizens have a higher churning rate.
6. Customers with Fibre Optic internet service have churned more. The payment method like Electronic check also makes a significant impact on churning decision.
7. If company doesn't provide services like Tech Support, Device Protection and Online Security then the customer will opt for another service.
